3D Resource Gathering Game Project Overview

Project Structure:
/src
  /core
    - InputManager.js: Handles keyboard and mouse input
    - gameState.js: Manages game state, inventory, and skills
  /entities
    - ResourceManager.js: Handles resource creation, collection, and respawning
  /config
    - gameConfig.js: Contains all game configuration settings
  /utils
    - (utility functions)

Key Components:

1. Resource System:
   - Two types of trees:
     * Basic Tree (tree1.glb)
       - Level 1 required
       - 1 wood per gather
       - 15 XP per gather
       - 5 health
       - 30s respawn
     * Advanced Tree (tree2.glb)
       - Level 5 required
       - 3 wood per gather
       - 150 XP per gather
       - 8 health
       - 45s respawn
   - Rocks:
     * Level 1 required
     * 1 ore per gather
     * 10 XP per gather
     * 5 health
     * 45s respawn

2. Resource Manager Features:
   - Spawns resources in random positions
   - 80% basic trees, 20% advanced trees
   - Handles resource collection
   - Manages respawning
   - Collision detection
   - Debug mode with visible collision boxes

3. Game State:
   - Tracks inventory (wood, ore)
   - Manages skills (lumberjack, mining)
   - Handles XP and leveling
   - Updates UI elements

4. Input System:
   - WASD/Arrow keys for movement
   - Right-click drag for camera rotation
   - Left-click for resource gathering
   - 'D' key to toggle debug mode

5. Debug Features:
   - Toggle with 'D' key
   - Shows red wireframe collision boxes
   - Console logging for resource interactions
   - Resource counts and health display

6. Resource Collection Mechanics:
   - Level requirements
   - Health system (multiple hits to deplete)
   - XP rewards
   - Resource amounts
   - Respawn timers

7. File Structure:
   - main.js: Main game loop and setup
   - assets/: Contains 3D models (tree1.glb, tree2.glb, rock1.glb)
   - src/: Core game logic and configuration

8. Configuration (gameConfig.js):
   - Resource settings (health, respawn times, XP)
   - Camera settings
   - Movement settings
   - Collection settings
   - Spawn area boundaries

9. Current Features:
   - 3D resource gathering
   - Skill-based progression
   - Multiple resource types
   - Debug visualization
   - Resource respawning
   - Level requirements
   - XP system

10. Recent Changes:
    - Added advanced trees with higher XP rewards
    - Implemented proper collision detection
    - Added debug mode
    - Improved resource management
    - Added level requirements
    - Balanced XP rewards

This overview should help quickly understand the project structure, key features, and recent changes. The game is a 3D resource gathering game with progression through skill levels and different types of resources to gather.
