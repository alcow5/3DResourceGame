# 3D Game Concept

A 3D game built with Three.js and Vite, featuring:
- 3D environment with textured ground
- Character movement system
- Resource collection mechanics
- Dynamic camera controls

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## How to Start the Vite Development Server

1. **Open a terminal** and navigate to your project directory:
   ```
   cd "C:\Users\Alex\Projects\3d Game concept"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (only needed the first time or after adding new packages):
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Vite development server:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   - This will start the server and show a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173/`).
   - Open that URL in your web browser to view your game.

4. **(Optional) To expose the server on your local network:**
   ```
   npm run dev -- --host
   ```

5. **To stop the server:**  
   Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
